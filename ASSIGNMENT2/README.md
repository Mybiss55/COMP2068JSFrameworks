# Assignment 2 Fast Food App
#### Created by Myles Biss
#### This is my Final Assignment for JS Frameworks

## Description
#### The projects goal was to make a fast food tracking app, in which you could add items to an order. Then you would be able to pay for that order using Stripe.
#### Though I was unable to reach that point with this assignment, I did however do basically everything else. The app itself is kind of useless, but I think I nailed the main concepts and showed that I am able to make a CRUD web application.

## Features
- Full CRUD Functionality
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Login with Github
- Home Page
- Hosted on Cloud (See Below)

## Planned Features
#### Features I intended on creating, but couldn't get to
- Stripe Payments
- Carts
- One to Many Orders & Items
- Better CSS Polish
- Admin Users
- Customer Users

## Personal Take
#### I wanted to make this an actual web application which could function as a store, but due to restrictions I was unable to reach the gold standard I wanted it to reach :( 
#### Regardless! I hope you like what I've done!
